<h4>Intro Lab:</h4>
<p>I ran into a little difficulty with the intro lab. The example shown in the pdf in figure 4 was not what I was seeing on my screen. I have about 11 different capture interfaces that were available on my Wireshark. Whereas the example only had two capture interfaces. The example also said to select Gigabit Network Connection, and I did not have that option on my wireshark. Thus, It took me a little bit to figure out what one I needed to use for the intro lab and to follow the examples. I eventually found out it was Microsoft: Wi-fi that I wanted to use. I figured this out because it was the only one out of my eleven choices that outputted the intro-wireshark-file1.html.</p>
<p>Another issue I ran into while doing the intro lab was again in figure 4. In figure 4 it showed a start button right next to the options. Mine did not have any start buttons at all. I was just randomly clicking and saw that I could just double click on the selection I wanted, and it ran. </p>  
    <h4>IP Lab:</h4>
    <p>For this lab I downloaded ping plotter to capture my pockets. I then recorded the pockets with Wireshark. I captured pockets from www.pingplotter.com on ping plotter. I captured 3 different packet sizes at 56, 2000, and 3500. I then analyzed all the information on Wireshark and ran though the questions in the lab. Showed me how ICMP Request has all different identifications and Time to Live, whereas the ICMP Time to Live all have the same identifications and Time to Live for the same sources. I found this interesting because I would have thought identifications should be different for all but its not the case for ICMP Time to Live.</p><p>
In the question on the lab they also asked us to investigate the fragment offsets for the 3 different pocket sizes. For my offset I noticed that for 56 the offset was 0 but for 2000 and 3500 the offset was the pocket size -20. For the replies however, there was a new section for the 2000 and 3500 with the IPv4 fragments. Each fragment is divided up by 1480 bytes and then the remainder.
