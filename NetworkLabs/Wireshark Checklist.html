<h4>Intro Lab:</h4>
<p>I ran into a little difficulty with the intro lab. The example shown in the pdf in figure 4 was not what I was seeing on my screen. I have about 11 different capture interfaces that were available on my Wireshark. Whereas the example only had two capture interfaces. The example also said to select Gigabit Network Connection, and I did not have that option on my wireshark. Thus, It took me a little bit to figure out what one I needed to use for the intro lab and to follow the examples. I eventually found out it was Microsoft: Wi-fi that I wanted to use. I figured this out because it was the only one out of my eleven choices that outputted the intro-wireshark-file1.html.</p>
<p>Another issue I ran into while doing the intro lab was again in figure 4. In figure 4 it showed a start button right next to the options. Mine did not have any start buttons at all. I was just randomly clicking and saw that I could just double click on the selection I wanted, and it ran. </p>  
    <h4>IP Lab:</h4>
    <p>For this lab I downloaded ping plotter to capture my pockets. I then recorded the pockets with Wireshark. I captured pockets from www.pingplotter.com on ping plotter. I captured 3 different packet sizes at 56, 2000, and 3500. I then analyzed all the information on Wireshark and ran though the questions in the lab. Showed me how ICMP Request has all different identifications and Time to Live, whereas the ICMP Time to Live all have the same identifications and Time to Live for the same sources. I found this interesting because I would have thought identifications should be different for all but it’s not the case for ICMP Time to Live.
</p>
    <h4>DNS Lab</h4>
    <p>
For this lab I ran nslookup in my windows command prompt. I ran the code suggested in the lab as nslookup www.mit.edu I also ran nslookup www.studentaid.gov. In the example they showed the command had a server name. However, when I ran both of the commands my server name came up as unknow. Same thing happened when I ran the second command. However, when I ran the third command it gave me a server name but the DNS timed out. I decided I would continue with the lab and further investigate the issue later.    </p><p>
I looked into trying to get the issue resolved however, I was not able to. I tried to edit my firewall but could not find a workaround. Thus. I continued with the rest of the lab hoping I could still complete it.
    </p><p> 
I then used Wireshark to capture the DNS from the given website. I found out that my DNS pockets were being sent over UDP
    </p><p>
I then used Wireshark to capture the DNS from the given website. I found out that my DNS pockets were being sent over UDP. I was able to use ipconfig to compare the results from that to Wireshark.
    </p><p>
    The next part of the lab required to capture pockets with Wireshark and nslookup. At this point I stopped the lab because my nslookup was not working. I am going to see if I can get it to work on my mac or other windows. So after a few hours of trying I was not able to get the nslookup to work on any of the 4 computers in my home. Therefore, for this lab I downloaded the zip folder provided and looked at their data for the second half of this lab. I then went through the questions for each nslookup command and compared each data.
    </p>
    <h4>HTTP Lab</h4>
    <p>
    For this lab I captured a http pocket in Wireshark with the given 1-line html document. This one already looked different then the other labs I have done because it only produced 2 http pockets. All the other pockets I captured so had a lot more even with the filters on. I then ran thought the questions on the lab answering everything they asked. Then, I compared those answers with the raw data in the inspect on the html document. I found most the information was the same as the information in Wireshark. However, I did notice there were a few fields that were not in Wireshark. Cache-control, If-Modified since, if none match, and upgrade-insecure-requests were all listed in the raw data but not in the data in Wireshark.  </p><p>
I then ran the second html file and captured the pockets in Wireshark. This time I noticed that it had If-Modified since, if none match, Cache-control, and upgrade-insecure-requests listed in the Wireshark Get. As noted before those were not listed there in the first file. However, It did not give the line based text like the first file and third file did. I also noticed that the Status code and phrase for files one and three were the same but for this second file the status code and phrase were changed.</p><p>
I ran though and looked at the data for the fourth file as well. I noticed that it was similar to the second file. Lastly, I ran the fifth file twice. I ran it two times because The first time I did not read far enough in the lab to see they gave you a user name and password.
    </p>
    <h4>TCP Lab</h4>
    <p>
    For the TCP Lab I downloaded the given alice.txt file and then uploaded it to the gaia website given. After uploading the file, I ran my Wireshark to capture TCP pockets. Then, I hit the upload button on the website to fully upload the alice.txt file. I was able to capture quite a few TCP pockets. When filtering buy TPC I was also able to see two HTTP pockets listed for the website I used. I ended up hiding those pockets so I could focus on just the TCP pockets. </p><p>
	After looking at the data and answering some of the lab’s questions. I looked at the Round-Trip Time graph. For this graph I could only see one dot placed at approximately 55.2 Round Trip Time (ms) and 0.279447 Time(s). I played around with the Stream number in the graph depending on what number the stream is on the dot changes. And for this particular graph it disappeared completely at 14. </p><p>
	Looking at the next graph in the lab, Sequence Numbers (Stevens), I noticed right away mine was very different. They had a lot of dots in the graph that went from left to right upward. Whereas mine was a straight line on 0. I opened a few more of my pockets into the graph and noticed they all had straight lines or a single dot.
    </p>
    <h4>UDP Lab</h4>
    <p>
    This lab had me capture UDP pockets in Wireshark. Right off the bat this was different than the other labs so far. I was able to capture UPD pockets without doing anything at all, other than capturing pockets. I then answered the questions that were pervaded with the lab. Though the data that was given I was able to figure out the max number of bytes that my UDP pocket could hold and the max port number. I also looked for what the protocol number was for my UDP pockets, 17, and was able to highlight over that data and see that the hexadecimal was also highlighted, 0x11. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I also noticed some other cool information while doing this lab that I posted to our discussion board.
    </p>
    <h4>SSL Lab</h4>
    <p>
    For this lab they had me go shopping! I went on to my favorite cheap clothing store, Shein and looked at some clothes and added them to my cart. But because I am broke, I did not purchase anything and stopped collecting pockets there. For some reason, my pockets did not capture and SSL though. So, I downloaded the sample file and tried to filter by SSL, and it would not let me. So, I did some googling and it allowed me to filter by TLS and it showed me SSLv3 protocols. This still did not have an SSL head; however, it did have TLS and after looking at the image in the lab and the data I had I saw they were same information. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I looked at the data given in ClientHello SeverHello, changed Cipher Spec, Client Key Exchange, and Application Data and went through the lab questions that followed each section.
    </p>
    <p>
    After I answered the question based on the labs example, I went back to the pockets I captured and filtered them by the TLS. This time when I filtered it did not give an SSL, but it gave a TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3. I looked thought the data on these fields as well and saw that all the headers under its TLS were the same as the examples. Thus, I ran though the lab questions again with my own pockets. 
    </p>
    <h4>My post</h4>
    <p>I noticed when filtering by UDP that it also displayed a protocol called MDNS or Multicast Domain Name System. I found this interesting because it listed all the Google homes, Google home minis, Google chrome casts and the Google nest we have in our home. But we also have some Amazon Echo’s, Dots and Amazon fire sticks that were not picked up. Only google products were. I tried to google why this was the case. It was hard to find a solid answer. The only thing I found was that amazon products have a secret key that doesn’t allow them to be captured.</p><p>
    This filter also showed a DHCP or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for discover, where I work. I thought it was cool to see on there because I am doing this assignment on my personal computer not work computer. But it is still able to capture that because both computers are on the same network.</p>
