1. Name / Date:

2. Java version used, if not the official version for the class:

e.g. build 1.5.0_06-b05

3. Precise command-line compilation examples / instructions:

e.g.:

> javac JokeServer.java


4. Precise examples / instructions to run this program:

e.g.:

In separate shell windows:

> java JokeServer
> java JokeClient
> java JokeClientAdmin

All acceptable commands are displayed on the various consoles.

This runs across machines, in which case you have to pass the IP address of
the server to the clients. For exmaple, if the server is running at
140.192.1.22 then you would type:

> java JokeClient 140.192.1.22
> java JokeClientAdmin 140.192.1.22

5. List of files needed for running the program.

e.g.:

 a. checklist.html
 b. JokeServer.java
 c. JokeClient.java
 d. JokeClientAdmin.java

5. Notes:

e.g.:

I faked the random number generator. I have a bug that comes up once every
ten runs or so. If the server hangs, just kill it and restart it. You do not
have to restart the clients, they will find the server again when a request
is made.
